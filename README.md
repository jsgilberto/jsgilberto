### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jesus Alvarez, a Full Stack Developer from Mexico but currently living in Spain. I mainly code in Python and JavaScript, but I am always learning. I am currently working on a couple of freelance projects using microservices with Django which is a field I find very interesting :D
